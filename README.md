# __Introduction to Programming__

| My repository of exercicies for signature Introduction to Programming.

### Construction 🛠️
In this subject We work with language C++ and a IDE [Zinjai](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zinjai/). Personally I work under a GNU/Linux environment only with a console and any text-editor. Sometimes I use a IDE for debug.
* [GNU/Linux OS](https://www.linuxmint.com) - LinuxMint
_This is enought to develop in C++ but if you want use any IDE or complex text processor... use it!_

## Execute 🚀
If you want execute any exercise, first compile the source code with the next command:

```$g++ -o my_exec_file path_to_source_file.cpp -Wall```

Help:

```g++ --help=warnings|common```
 
Parameters:
 * -o \<file>  _Place the output into <file>._
 * -Wall       _Enable most warning messages._

 ## Notice ⚠️
This source codes are solutions for programming subject's exercices, be careful if you copy&paste. Maybe the code works but It isn't the best or It has a lot personal annotation.

Exits a lot of ways resolve a same problem. I don't care if You 've can resolve a better(good for you!) or I'm wrong with my coding way because I'm always learning in my career and life. I will better in next commit!
